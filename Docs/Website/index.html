<h1>Freshwater Ecology Gaming</h1>

<p>We consider games as simple and understandable tools to explain environmental issues, for which an increasing awarness is required but the corresponding knowledge not necessarily easy to acquire.
<br/>
Our project consists in transmiting basic concepts of freshwater ecology, through a boardgame and a computer game that are complementary in their objectives.
<br/>
More details are available in the Poster presented at SETAC 2016 : Serra H. and Raimbault J. (2016). Game-based tools to transmit freshwater ecology concept, poster presented at SETAC 2016, Nantes. <a href="SETAC2016_poster_jeu_vfinale.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
An online version of the computer game is available above as a NetLogoweb model. Rules are given in the info tab.
<br/> 
Please use preferentially Firefox/Chrome for performance purposes. The web version being client-side, poor performance can occur depending on your device, you may then want to try the desktop version which you can download as a NetLogo model <a href="AquaEcoGame.nlogo" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also check out the <a href="https://github.com/JusteRaimbault/MediationEcotox" target="_blank">repository</a> of the project, contributions and suggestions are welcomed.
