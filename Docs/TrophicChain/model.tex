\section*{Model Description}

\paragraph{Initial configuration}



\paragraph{Dynamics}

We denote by $\tau$ the duration of a time step. At each time step, following events sequentially take place.

\begin{itemize}
\item Fishes move by random steering : each fishes chooses an uniform random heading and go forward (in the two dimensional vertical space) of $d_w$ spatial units if the destination position lays in their authorized area (\textit{no species spacial constraint implemented for now}). Their energy is correspondingly updated by $E=E - d_w \cdot c_w$ where $c_w$ is a wandering cost (energy per spatial unit). Note that this cost captures other ``life costs'' that are not taken into account in other actions such as reproduction.
\item Moving ressources wander the same way. \textit{not implemented yet}
\item Fishes eat according to trophic matrices : ressources potentially eaten by a species are effectively eaten if they are within a radius $r_r$ ; fishes within a radius $r_f$
\item Fishes do reproduce : potential mates are search for within $r_f$, reproduction is done at a cost $c_r$
\item Fishes with negative energy or too old die 
\end{itemize}
